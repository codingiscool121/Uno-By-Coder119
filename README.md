This is an uno game that can be played online. I do not have claim to have created the idea of uno or the rules in any way. This game is merely for fun, and can be used in any way you would like. 

Known Bugs: If a player puts a +4, another player can put a +2. I programmed this thinking that this was the rule, but later, I found out that it wasn't. If somebody could help me fix this, that would be great.
